                                Since the past iGEM experience in 2018, this year the Madrid iGEM Team has gathered not just a handful of students from a single faculty, but 13 participants from all around the region, each one of them with deep knowledge about different aspects of the project. This year, we have already understood what working in a multidisciplinary environment means: biologists, chemists, engineers, anthropologists, designers, computer scientists and pharmacists united for a common goal.

                                     In recent years sensing technology has become a crucial tool for quick development in science.  Measuring means knowledge and the more reliable and fast it is, the better we can understand the world we live in.  Once a standarized sensing tool is developed it allows using them for developing deeper knowledge.

                                     We have been privileged to be part of a project as significant as iGEM, with all that that implies. As a team we have had the opportunity to be in contact with top researchers in their respective fields, biotechnology companies and another resources that most other students lack.  ThatÂ´s why we have decided to take advantage of this opportunity and use most of these resources in order to contribute solving real problems, besides developing an innovative project.

                                                In order to design an effective solution, we embrace different fields: biosensing aptamer-based technology, synthetic biology, hardware and sensor development, mathematical and deep learning modeling tools, software and human practices.

                                                The core of the project aims at developing two sensing solutions: a quantitative real-time potentiometric detection, and a lateral flow assay for presumptive quick identification of V. Cholerae. First one addressed to high infrastructure contexts, and the second one oriented for low-infrastructure backgrounds.

                                                The technological core of sensors relies on aptamers as molecular probes. Our goal is to create a semi-automatized aptamer discovery procedure which we will employ for the discovery of a new V. Cholerae aptamer, targeting the Omp-T specific to Vibrio Cholerae.

                                                In order to avoid direct experimentation with Risk 2 live organisms such as V. Cholerae, We will engineer an E. Coli in order to express a V. Cholerae specific region of Omp-T. Our chassis will be an E. Coli K12 and lamB gene expression.
